# XilophoneSaysGame

Challenge 1: Convert the Xilophone App into a Simon Says game of 7 musical notes.


The challenge of this development is to apply the knowledge obtained in one of the exercises developed in the course “The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp” Taught by Dr. Angela Yu (Developer and Lead Instructor) 
By learning to use the specific tools applied in this exercise In particular, I set myself a new challenge to add functions to personalize the application and turn it into a more complex project, where I can incorporate new knowledge and make the APP become an incipient interactive game.

The course exercise consisted of creating a music app; we developed our first musical instrument! The module consisted of creating a colorful Xilophone app that could play sound using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.

I found this exercise so fun that I spent several hours playing with this project and looking for material to make it grow.

Being a big fan of the game Simon Says since I was a child, I was tempted to turn the musical Xilophone App into an interactive game where the challenge I propose (as an initial stage) is to be able to copy a musical sequence in order, a random sequence that dictates the game. with sounds and lights. 
I basically turned the Xilophone into a 7-note musical Simon Says.
